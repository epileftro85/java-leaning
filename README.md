# Java Learning
This repo is intended to be an easy way to learn languages from examples, the rules are simple:
1. Read the readme and understand it.
2. Create your project with whatever you want. Plain Java, gradle, IDE, etc. (First project is plain java with shell, second and nexts are with gradle)
3. Use Google or the search engine you want. Avoid AI use (This will help you to investigate and develop your skills).
4. Do no see the code in the project, this can be comparated at the end. (maybe your code is better than mine).
5. Use any language you want, this repo will support Java, C++ for now.
